## Runescape Music Player ðŸŽµ


This is my first application using SFML. This project is testing the audio and
graphics capabilities of SFML, I play a random song from runescape and display
a picture of a gnome on the screen this is literally the easiest thing you can
make with SFML, so easy starting application.


## Adding in the Future

As the project name suggests "Runescape Music Player", I may actually make this
a working application in the future where the application just plays runescape
music. But as we all know coming back to old projects never happens so I
wouldn't really count on it.
